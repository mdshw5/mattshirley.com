# Salzberg stakes creationists

![](http://www.factzoo.com/sites/all/img/insects/leaf-insect.jpg) 

In a [recent post on his blog at Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/2012/03/11/evolution-bugs-people/), Steven Salzberg elaborates on the cover image for a new textbook, and uses "leaf insects" as an example of strong evidence in support of evolution. He points out that there is growing support for evolution with younger Americans. 

> So perhaps in another hundred years or so, Americans will start to “get” evolution. But it might take longer: apparently [18% of Americans still believe](http://www.gallup.com/poll/3742/new-poll-gauges-americans-general-knowledge-levels.aspx) that the sun revolves around the earth.  So it’s taken us 500 years to get to 80% for that one.
