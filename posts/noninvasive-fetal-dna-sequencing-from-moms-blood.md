# Noninvasive fetal DNA sequencing from mom's blood

There have been [quite](http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/publishahead/Genome_Wide_Fetal_Aneuploidy_Detection_by_Maternal.99963.aspx) a [few](http://www.fasebj.org/content/26/1/250.short) [publications](http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/2012/05000/Is_Cell_Free_Fetal_DNA_From_Maternal_Blood_Finally.1.aspx) [recently](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature11251.html) that detail methods that may currently be used to isolate and sequence fetal DNA from circulating maternal blood plasma. This is quite and achievement, and represents a vast improvement over previous methods for fetal genetic testing which typically involve extracting a few milliliters of amniotic fluid through a large needle inserted through the abdomen wall and through the uterus (ouch!).  The methods for detecting circulating fetal DNA have existed for [more than a decade](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673697021740), but recent advances in 2nd generation genome sequencing technologies now allow construction of libraries for whole genome sequencing from this material. According to a recent [Reuters article ](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/04/us-prenatal-idUSBRE8630L420120704?feedType=RSS&feedName=scienceNews&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&dlvrit=309301)this could allow early detection of virtually any known genetic abnormality. Most news articles right now focus on the ethical implications surrounding genetic selection, but I think this is premature. We have the capability to detect large, well characterized genetic abnormalities (some 3,000 of them) today, using existing methods. What is more disturbing than the potential for early genetic selection is the potential for mischaracterization of genetic anomalies [as disease-related](/?p=107); something we already perform poorly at. If we limit findings to well-known genotype-phenotype relationships, sequencing of fetal DNA from blood should only easy the discomfort of expecting moms.
