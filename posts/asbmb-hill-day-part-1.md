# ASBMB Hill Day: Part 1

Day one of the ASBMB hill day was comprised of checking in to the hotel and attending an informational seminar about legislative procedure - [School House Rock](www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-eYBZFEzf8) style. Tomorrow will be not only busy with meetings, but there will also be lots of people on the Hill for the ["ObamaCare" hearings](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/74525.html). We learned which Senators and Representatives we would be meeting with, and then proceded to have dinner at [CESCO ostaria](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=17409901153496994321&q=cesco&hl=en&ved=0CBgQ-gswAA&sa=X&ei=-2hyT_2JI5O68gbvuYmhDQ&sig2=okl8y-t3Vli4PPpt4ksosg)Â - which was quite good. Then off to bed, for tomorrow will bring lots of walking and talking... [![](/uploads/2012/03/IMG_1427-1024x768.jpg)](/uploads/2012/03/IMG_1427.jpg)
