# Associate editor of Genomics resigns due to closed-access policy

[Winston Hide](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/faculty/winston-hide/), an associate editor at the academic journal [Genomics](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/genomics/), announced his resignation in an article at The Guardian yesterday. Hide's concerns over the impact of restrictive journal article access on science in developing countries is a problem that I had not considered much at all before today. Sure, I support publishing in open access journals such as PLoS, but the arguments and opinions that formed my opinion were mostly framed around the cost to university libraries. What I had not considered is what happens when there _is no library._Â Sending PDF email attachments of journal articles is prohibited by the copyright agreements of closed-access journals, and yet Hide mentions that that is sometimes the only way researchers can reasonably stay current in their field: 

> In reality, the modus operandi is "please can you send me a pdf". Alternatively some researchers spend part of their research grant to buy a subscription to the journal they need.

At this point in my career, I could not reasonably choose to limit myself to submitting or reading papers from only open-access journals. It's good to see that some of the established researchers who have attained success on the closed-access model rejecting it.
