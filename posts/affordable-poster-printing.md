# Affordable poster printing

A couple of months ago, I was exploring internet - based poster printing companies, and discovered that the quality and price varies widely. It was tempting to just go with our local University printing service ($300 per poster for full color), but I decided to give [PrintingForLess.com](http://www.printingforless.com/) a try. Based on user reviews, it seemed like this was one of the best online printing companies right now, which turned out to be completely true. The print quality is excellent, turn-around time is second to none (possibly better than a local company, at around four days), and the service agents actually proof your work and contact you to make sure everything will look perfect. They offer $40 off your first order with no minimum. I've recently ordered some free business cards, but you could just as easily apply it toward a poster (starting at around $100, including shipping) for your next poster session or conference. Just enter the coupon codeÂ **RP1G5RD3N** at checkout. For a grad student on a budget, PFL were a godsend.  [![](/uploads/2012/07/poster.png)](/?attachment_id=162)
