# A number for every Wang?

I apologize for the title of this post, [for several](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Mitchell_and_Webb_Look#Reception) funny [reasons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjOZtWZ56lc). On a serious note, what if you are a [Wang](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=wang) or [Zhu](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=zhu) or even a [Johnson](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=johnson) and you want to be recognized for your scientific contributions? Right now it's a little difficult to stand out from the crowd of [Smiths](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=smith), but if the Open Researcher and Contributor ID ([ORCID](http://about.orcid.org)) committee has any say every author of peer reviewed research will [have an accession number attached to their identity](http://www.nature.com/news/scientists-your-number-is-up-1.10740). Imagine if we still searched for DNA sequences by gene name? What if your gene has multiple isoforms? What if it is a member of a family? What species are you looking for? Accession numbers are already attached to genes, proteins, and even academic research articles (see [DOI](http://www.doi.org)). I am fully in support of this type of project, and cannot wait to get my ORCID. Now I can finally distance myself [all those doppelgängers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=shirley%20m).
