# A penny for your thoughts?

![](http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/files/2012/07/responsefigure.jpg)

A [recent post](http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2012/07/23/no-comment/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plos%2FOneBlog+%28Blogs+-+everyONE%29) at the [PLoS ONE blog](http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/) caught my attention. [Ethan Perlstein](http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/author/eperlstein/) writes about his experience soliciting comments on [his recent publication](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0034024). His success rate? 4.6%. Of 166 professors working in his field. 49 of which he had previous contact with. 

> The most negative response was this remark from a full professor with whom I had no prior contact: “_Most of us just let our published work speak for itself_.”

Also, 

> The most recent statistics indicate that 90% of _PLOS__ONE_ articles have zero comments, and that an article with 14 comments (like mine) is in the top 0.001%.

The conclusion is that converting online views into actionable items (comments or, in most other online scenarios sales) is exceedingly difficult. We should be incentivizing others in our research fields to interact with each other. Since egos run wild in science, maybe a "reputation" system would held (see [Biostars](http://www.biostars.org) as an excellent example). Or, you could just disable comments.
