#New business cards

I've been meaning to make some new business cards for a while. The cards just needed to represent my interests and demonstrate a basic programming knowledge. Writing Python classes has always seemed a bit anthropomorphic, what with all the references to ´self´. I wanted to write some code that is both valid and functional in the sense that a non-programmer could still contact me. With that in mind I've created a small class that represents myself, and contains a small brain that keeps adding new skills endlessly. Just like my actual brain though, this one is easily cluttered with nonsense. Like always I used [PrintingForLess.com](http://www.printingforless.com/) since they've always treated my properly.
