# F1000 Research first articles appear online

Faculty of 1000 Research [recently announced they were almost ready](/?p=177) to publish their first articles, and they weren't kidding. Today marks the publication of its [first three papers](http://f1000research.com/2012/07/16/announcing-our-first-articles/). Of particular interest to me is a simple [benchmark of most modern NGS aligners](http://f1000research.com/articles/considerations-for-clinical-read-alignment-and-mutational-profiling-using-next-generation-sequencing/), with a focus on predictive power to sensitively detect clinically relevant mutations in the BRCA1 gene. Also of interest is an [analysis of publicly available methods](http://f1000research.com/articles/low-budget-analysis-of-direct-to-consumer-genomic-testing-familial-data/) to interpret direct-to-consumer SNP array data (think [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/)) and exome sequence from a two-generation pedigree. One disappointing note - the widget F1000 is using for data viewing is silently blocked behind the firewall where I work. EDIT: the admin for the widget has contacted me, and says they will be working to fix the blocking issue. I think it's great that F1000 Research is trying to integrate data accessÂ into the journal articles.
