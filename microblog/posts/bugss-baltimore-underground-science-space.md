# BUGSS: Baltimore Underground Science Space

Tomorrow, Baltimore's newest (only?) "bio-space" is hosting a hands-on synthetic biology workshop. [BUGSS](http://www.bugssonline.org) is not a group I'm associated with, but that may change soon, because it looks like they are having tons of fun. With a bit of lab equipment and some e.coli, these guys are hosting some 18+ and all-ages workshops to expose more people to actual molecular biology experiments. I wish this type of thing existed when I was in high-school.
