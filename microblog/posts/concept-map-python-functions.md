# Software Carpentry concept map

I recently started taking the Software Carpentry Foundation instructor training,
and would highly recommend the course to anyone interested in teaching
computing concepts to scientists. Our first assignment was to make a [concept
map](http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/?p=8567), and my example is
attached below. The idea of a concept map is to outline key ideas as nodes,
with relationships between ideas as labeled edges.
