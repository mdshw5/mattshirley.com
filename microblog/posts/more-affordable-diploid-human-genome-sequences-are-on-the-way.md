# More affordable diploid human genome sequences are on the way

Did you know that most human genome sequencing currently discards information from half of your genome? Really, it does. We each have two copies of a human genome - one from mom and one from dad. In cancer cells, it is sometimes important to know whether the two critical mutations in a tumor suppressor are located in the same copy of the gene (resulting in a proliferating cell), or on opposite copies (increasing your risk of developing this type of cancer). A [recent Nature paper](http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nature/rss/current/~3/IVHq3QveEF8/nature11236) describes new methods able to phase haplotype information for an entire human genome resequencing project. Moreover, this method only uses _100 picograms of genomic DNA._ If you are wondering how many copies of the human genome that corresponds to, the authors kindly put that information in the title: "_Accurate whole-genome sequencing and haplotyping from 10 to 20 human cells_". The method is truly novel, and to achieve this feat whole genome amplification was used. As a side effect of the method, since every fragment of DNA is sequenced on average 10 to 40 times more than usual, error rates are also extremely low.
