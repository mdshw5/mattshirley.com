# Rhetological fallacies

This [post over at Information is Beautiful](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2012/rhetological-fallacies/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+InformationIsBeautiful+%28Information+Is+Beautiful%29) sums up all the logical fallacies I remember (or do not remember) from college philosophy classes: 

> Relativist fallacy: Rejecting a claim because of a belief that truth is relative to a person or group.

What I really like about the chart in the post is that it is geared toward political rhetoric. In fact, the author coins a word - rhetological - to describe where to apply this chart. I'll be keeping it handy during the 2012 election campaigns. Source - [http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/)
