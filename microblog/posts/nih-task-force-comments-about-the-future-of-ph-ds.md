# NIH task force comments about the future of Ph.Ds

Over at the ASBMB policy blog, I found a summary of NIH recommendations about the current surplus of researchers in biomedical sciences. This is nothing new. We've known for a while now that the average age of first R01 award is going up. The task force says that age is now 42. To curb the impact of the impending "grad student bubble" bursting, the task force lays out [recommendations for institutions regarding funding and training](http://acd.od.nih.gov/bmw_report.pdf). The ASBMB blog has a succinct list of bullet points for these: 

>   * Shift more graduate students and postdocs onto training and fellowship grants and off research grants.
>   * Encourage and aid universities in offering non academic career-training options to graduate students and postdocs.
>   * Cap the number of years a graduate student can receive NIH funding to six years.
>   * Increase the minimum postdoc stipend to $42,000 and increase postdoc benefits.
>   * Allow funding for more staff scientist positions.
>   * Expand early career awards for junior faculty members.

I particularly like the recommendations for increasing postdoc salaries, as well as staff scientist positions. [Hopkins BCMB](http://biolchem.bs.jhmi.edu/bcmb/Pages/about/index.aspx) is already working on increasing its training for non-academic careers, hosting panel discussions and workshops. What worries me is _capping the number of years that a graduate student can receive NIH funding _at six years. Luckily, this change will probably never affect me.
