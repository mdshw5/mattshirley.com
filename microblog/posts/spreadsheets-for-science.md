# Spreadsheets for Science?

What place do spreadsheets have in biological sciences? Are they a useful format for data sharing with colleagues, or a useless blight on information superhighway? Your opinion of spreadsheets might directly correlate with your technical knowledge. For the scientist who understands that "[everything is a file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file)" and expects to read and write their data to straightforward and open formats, spreadsheets might be something of a nuisance. For the scientist whose first and last word in statistics is Microsoft Excel, spreadsheets are an essential and powerful window into a set of data. What if you more are interested in motif detection and DNA transcription than column sums and vlookups?  It would be convenient for most biologists if a spreadsheet could handle this type of task. [Pierre Lindenbaum](http://www.blogger.com/profile/13765837643388003852) has [written an excellent example](http://plindenbaum.blogspot.com/2012/09/translating-dna-sequence-into-google.html) of such a utility on his blog. Implemented in javascript, and utilizing [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) in Google Drive (Docs), his utility will translate a DNA sequence into a protein sequence. Pretty neat.
